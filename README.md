## New Hai Cheng Software

## Overview
This project provides a visually captivating HTML/CSS template designed as an introduction to a software cover or launch page related to the works of Makoto Shinkai. The template combines color gradients, blurred image overlays and dynamic button styling to create an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Linear Gradient Background**: color transition from #00BFFF to #1E90FF gives a modern aesthetic.
- **Blurred Image Overlay**: use images associated with Makoto Shinkai's art or movies, blurred and blended into the gradient background to add depth.
- **Responsive Design**: ensures a beautiful display on a variety of devices, using Flexbox for alignment.
- **Custom Fonts and Button Styles**: Customized font sizes, colors and styles, as well as dynamic button effects, enhance the user interaction experience.

## How to use
1. **Replace image placeholder**: replace `your_image_here.jpg` in CSS with the actual image path or URL representing Makoto Shinkai's work.
2. **Adjust fonts and styles**: customize font sizes, colors and styles according to your branding or design requirements.
3. **Add functionality to the button**: The current “Start Journey” button is set to trigger a warning. You can replace the `onclick` property to link to another page or trigger an event using JavaScript.

## Dependencies
- **Font Awesome**: Use icons via CDN links. Make sure you have an internet connection or local hosting.
- **External CSS and Fonts**: projects use inline CSS to simplify. For larger projects, consider moving styles to an external stylesheet.
